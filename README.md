# Literate

The purpose of literate is to use literate programming as seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). This is meant to be a slightly compatable with the literate program [here](https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate) which sadly seems to be orphaned/abandoned now. 

This program is written in a way that it is usable by the nvim plugin [here](https://github.com/zyedidia/literate.vim).

At this moment the program only reads a .lit file and creates the code file from it. 

The program only requires python2 or python3 it works with both. 

To use the programm run 
    literate --help 
or 
    literate filename.lit
