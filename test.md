# TITLE

## A HEADING WE USE!
Notice how the block can have capital letters or spaces.
Also take a notice as to the indentations, this is important on the output.
Only filenames can contain a . if a code block contains a "." then it is considered as a file.
You can have multiple code files per lit file.

> ### filename.py
~~~
#!/user/binary/executable

some code here {
}
~~~

## Another heading
qwerty

### Heading 3
qwerty

#### Heading 4
Take a notice how its written here as "block 2" isntead of "block2". This is acceptable, meaning it ignores spaces and capitalizations.
You can call other codeblocks from a codeblock that is acceptable.
If you call a block that does not exist the program will not crash but the block will be a blank line.
The only not accepted label is "__literateplaceholderblockname___", all other names are just fine.
> ##### block2
~~~
some stuff here
    INDENTED STUFF HERE
~~~

## Header
This is "block 3   ", where it has three trailing spaces. This is also acceptable.
Here "b LOCK 3" is equal to "block 3"
> ### block3
~~~
code here
~~~

## HEADER
This code segment is not found anywhere in the filename and therefore will not be included.
> ### notblock
